					<accordion [title]="'Where does the data come from?'">
						<p class="accordion__text">The public procurement dataset published on Opentender Kenya was collected from the national Public Procurement Information Portal managed by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA). Data is covered between the period of 2018 and 2019. Notices and awarded contracts were stored separately on the national public procurement portal. There were 890 awarded contracts and 1141 incomplete notices. Notice information highly overlapped with contract award data, files were appended to each other.

					<accordion [title]="'Improvement and standardization of geographic information in the dataset'">
						<p class="accordion__text">In order to show regional level aggregated information on the website, we needed precise addresses but the original data source lacked any geographic information. To get exact and consistent addresses for all contracts, we gathered geographic information manually on all buying entities using Google search, then we matched them to the dataset by buyer name. Based on the addresses, we were able to assign regional codes to the contracts.  First two letters of the geographic code (KE) refer to the country, the first digit indicates one of the 8 regional subdivisions, and the second digit indicates one of the 47 counties.</p>

					<accordion [title]="'Standardization of products and services'">
						<p class="accordion__text">In order to show market level aggregated information, we needed to classify products and services into groups. As source data lacked information on product classification, we assigned CPV (Common Procurement Vocabulary) product codes to tenders based on a list of keywords including the first 100 most frequent expressions product descriptions and an additional list of healthcare related words.</p>
						<p class="accordion__text">CPV codes are 8 digit codes, where the first 2 digits specify divisions, higher market levels, such as ‘33-Medical equipment, pharmaceutical products’, the first 3 digits refers to groups, for example ‘331-Medical equipments’, the first 4 digits identify classes, for example:‘3316- Operating techniques’, and the first 5 digits indicate categories, for example ‘33161-Electrosurgical unit‘.

					<accordion [title]="'Classification of procedure types'">
						<p class="accordion__text">Public procurement procedure types are classified into higher level groups based on the level of competition they allow. In Kenya, open tenders and two stage tendering were classified as open procedure; direct procurement as outright award; expression of interest, and electronic reverse auction as other procurement methods. Request for quotation was categorised as approaching bidders, design competition as design contest, framework agreement as DPS (Dynamic Purchase System), request for proposal as negotiated with publication, and restricted remained restricted.</p>
					</accordion>
				</div>
				<div class="about__flex-wrap">
					<accordion [title]="'Classification of buyer types'">
						<p class="accordion__text">In the Opentender Kenya website, there is an option to limit the comparison to buyers with the same buyer type in the benchmarking part of the buyer profile page. We grouped buyers into the following categories: national authority, national agency, public body, regional authority, regional agency and other.</p>
						<p class="accordion__text">National authorities are at the central level of government. Entities with regulatory power like ministries, national councils and commissions fall into this category. Regional and local authorities have limited decision making power, providing public services at regional or municipal level. Hospitals, universities, regional administrations are included in these categories.</p>
						<p class="accordion__text">Buyer types were assigned to procuring entities by using a list of keywords (‘ministry’, ‘national’, ‘regional’, ‘university’, etc.), which appeared in the buyers’ name. ‘Other’ category was assigned if the buyer name was available but could not be classified with the abovementioned method.</p>

					<accordion [title]="'How are health sector tenders identified?'">
						<p class="accordion__text">The original public procurement data source did not contain information on product classification. Therefore, health sector tenders were identified by a list of keywords (more than 1000 words) that capture different health care services, medical equipment and pharmaceutical products. Based on the keywords, product codes were assigned to the relevant tenders using the standard CPV (Common Procurement Vocabulary) nomenclature.</p>

					<accordion [title]="'Definition of Integrity Indicators'">
						<p class="accordion__text">The Integrity Indicator methodology is based on a corruption definition specific to public procurement, which refers to the allocation and performance of public contracts by distorting the principles of open and fair government contracting in order to benefit some to the detriment of all others. In other words, the aim of corruption is to avoid or distort competition in order to favour a certain, connected bidder.</p>
						<p class="accordion__text">One way to measure this phenomenon is to consider the lack of bidders for government contracts (single-bidding) as an outcome, whereas, adverse tendering practices (for example, choosing non-open procedure types and shortening advertising period) as inputs of the low-integrity procurement process. The ‘red flags’, that are most likely to signal integrity risks, were identified in a statistical analysis. Tendering characteristics that had a significant and positive relationship with single-bidding are defined as red flags.</p>
						<p class="accordion__text">Integrity Indicator list in Kenya:</p>
						<ul class="accordion__list">
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Single bidder contract</strong>: Single bidding is the simplest indication of restricted competition reflecting our corruption definition when only one bid is submitted for a tender on a competitive market (for further discussion of single bidding see Charron, Dahlström, Fazekas, & Lapuente, 2017). Sources: Single bidding is the simplest indication of restricted competition reflecting our corruption definition when only one bid is submitted for a tender on a competitive market (for further discussion of single bidding see Charron, Dahlström, Fazekas, & Lapuente, 2017).

							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Length of advertisement period</strong>: A short submission period, that is the number of days between publishing a tender and the submission deadline, leaves less time and thus makes it harder for non-connected companies to bid successfully, whereas a well-connected firm can use its inside knowledge to win repeatedly as the buyer can informally inform the favoured bidder about the opportunity ahead of time.</li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Call for tenders publication</strong>: Not publishing the call for tenders makes it less likely that eligible bidders notice the bidding opportunity, weakening the competition and allowing the contracting bodies to more easily award contracts repeatedly to a well-connected company.</li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Procedure type</strong>: Using procedure types which are less transparent and require less open competition can indicate the deliberate limitation of the range of bids received and to exclude bids as well as creating more opportunities for contracting bodies to repeatedly award contracts to the same well-connected company.</li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Length of decision period</strong>: an excessively short or long decision period, that is the number of days between the submission deadline and the contract award decision, can signal integrity risks. Snap decisions may reflect premeditated assessment, while long decision periods signal extensive legal challenges to the tender, suggesting that the issuer attempted to limit competition.</li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Description length</strong>: lack or minimal availability of information on the purchased item, especially in case of large volume contracts might be a signal of corruption risk, making it difficult to track public money spending.</li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Winner's contract share</strong>: Suppliers' share in a buyer's total spending can be used to measure the level of competitiveness and market openness. High supplier spending share, when a supplier or group of suppliers are awarded most procurement spending per buyer, can signal that a network has captured public contracting, potentially leading to higher prices, lower quality of work and value for money.</li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Length of signature period</strong>: Lengthy signature period might signal post contract modifications, disagreement between the buyer and supplier, legal challenges (appeals) that prohibit contract realization.</li>
